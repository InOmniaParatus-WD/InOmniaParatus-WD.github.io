# Portfolio

### Check out the project [here](https://inomniaparatus-wd.github.io/).

- A collection of front end projects built predominantly with HTML, JavaScript and CSS
- Some are part of certifications such as the ones on freeCodeCamp, others are independent projects as part of my programming learning journey
- Each project in the repo contains a link to a live view
