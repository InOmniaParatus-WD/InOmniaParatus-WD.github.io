# A freeCodeCamp short, fun challenge, with some extra features

### The challenge and its expected outcome: 
- Build six squares with no color
- Every time you click one, it turns green
- When the last square turns green, they all go back to the previous state in reverse order

### This here is my approach with some extra features
Final result looks like this 👇🏽
