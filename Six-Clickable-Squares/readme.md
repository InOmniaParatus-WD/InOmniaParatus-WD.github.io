# A freeCodeCamp short, fun challange, with some extra features

### The challange and its expected outcome: 
- Build six squares with no color
- Every time you click one, it turns green
- When the last square turns green, they all go back to no color in backwards sequence to which it was clicked (not all at once)

### This here is my approach with some extra features
Final result looks like this 👇🏽
