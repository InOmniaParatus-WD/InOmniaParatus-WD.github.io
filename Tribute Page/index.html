        <h3>Here's a time line of Eddie Kioki Mabo's life:</h3>

                    on pearling boats, as a cane cutter and a railway fetter. He marries Bonita Neehow, an
                    Australian-born South Sea Islander, and together they have ten children.</li>
                <li><span>1973</span> - Koiki co-founded the Townsville Black Community School, one of the first in

                    advisory board to the Commmonwealth Education Department where he served for three years.</li>
                <li><span>1981</span> - While working on campus as a gardner, Koiki gave a speech at James Cook
                    Univerisy in Queensland about the land inheritance system on Murray Island. "The significance of
                    this in terms of Australian common law doctrine was noted by one of the lawyers present at the
                    conference. He suggested there should be a test case to claim land rights through the court system.
                    Perth-based solicitor Greg McIntyre agrees to take the case. McIntyre represented Mabo during the
                    hearings.</li>
                <li><span>1982</span> - Koiki and fellow Mer Islanders, Reverend David Passi, Celuia Mapo Salee, Sam
                    Passi and James Rice began their legal claim in the High Court of Australia for ownership of their
                    lands on the island of Mer. </li>
                <li><span>1992</span> - Koiki died of cancer on 21st January. On 3rd June the Hight Court of
                    Australia ruled in his favour and his fellow plaintiffs.</li>
                <li><span>1993</span> - Parliment of Australia passes the <em>Native Title Act 1993</em> creating a
                    system which will allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Isladers to make a native title claim over
                    their lands.</li>

                <p>"It gave us back our pride. Until Mabo, we had been a forgotten people, even though we
                    knew
                    that we were in the right."</p>
